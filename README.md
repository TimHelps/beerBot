# beerBot
A learning project about robots and beer.

This is a multi-stage project to learn some Python robot control, computer vision, SLAM and more.

The project aim is to make a little robot that can be sent from the living room to the kitchen or larder, fetch a can of beer, and ferry it back to the living room.

The project can be decomposed into:

1) Robot design and manufacture. Try to whip something together quickly and get onto coding as that's the learning exercise.
2) Robot control, using Python. Raspberry Pi.
3) Robot sensing. Certainly a camera, maybe other sensors e.g. ultrasonic.
4) Robot localisation using sensing. Need to determine location, rotation etc.
5) Mapping/SLAM. How can robot localise the room its in?
6) Path planning. Can robot plan a route from, for example, living room to larder?
7) Beer collection/carrying.
